== What is OpenNMS

_OpenNMS_ is a free and open network management platform to give you the ability to solve problems in the domain of FCAPS footnote:[ISO Telecommunications Management Network model and framework for Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security categories] developed under the link:http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html[GNU Affero General Public License Version 3] license.
Main focus of _OpenNMS_ is fault- and performance management.
The application gives you access to the management data through a web interface and open a _ReST API_.
The _OpenNMS_ project is a collaboration of developers and network management specialists around the world, aiming to produce an open standard for a network management platform.

The project aims to deliver a solution for all types of network management issues, massively scalable and feature-rich.
The technology consists of a series of interrelated programs delivering various components for network management solution.

.OpenNMS high components

.Service Assurance
Detecting faults for services is an essential.
With _Service Assurance_ we mean in _OpenNMS_ everything related to the availability of a service.
_OpenNMS_ measures response times, availability and detect outages.
The results are forwarded as _Events_ through an _OpenNMS_ internal messaging system and can be used for further incident workflows.

.Performance Data Collection
Applications and network systems provide valuable performance metrics through management protocols or specific interfaces.
_OpenNMS_ provides access to management protocols like _SNMP_, _JDBC_, _JMX_, _WMI_ or _NSClient_ without coding just through configuration.
To be able to integrate application specific performance data it is possible to use a generic _HTTP_ collector and can also be combined with a generic _XML collector_.

.Provisioning
Large networks build workflows to define a life cycle of devices and applications in a network.
The _Provisioning system_ provides entry points in the UI, on the command line, and via programming interfaces to allow you to add, modify, and remove nodes and services.
In addition to specifying what to manage up front, services and nodes can also be automatically detected and the system allows a flexible mixture of both types of provisioning.

.Notifications
Monitoring services is not enough and it is often necessary to establish workflows to get peoples attention to deal with outages.
With an extensible _Notification_ system you can notify and build escalation plans for users and groups.
_Notifications_ can be send via several media types like Mail, Jabber or SMS.
The basis for _Notifications_ in OpenNMS are _Events_.

.Alarms and Event Correlation
_Alarms_ are generated from _Events_ and are on a higher level.
To correlate _Events_ to _Alarms_ there is a build in _Event_ deduplication and allows the usage of link:http://drools.org/[Drools].
_Alarms_ can be integrated into service desk or incident management systems, i.e. link:http://www.otrs.org/[OTRS], link:https://bestpractical.com/rt/[RT].

.ReST API
To allow integration in complex environments _OpenNMS_ provides a variety of link:http://docs.opennms.org/OpenNMS/snapshot/develop/documentation/guide-development/#_rest_api[ReST programming interfaces].
It is possible to get node assets, outages, alarms, notifications, events and collected performance data through a unified ReST API.

.Event driven messaging
Generated or received events are forwarded and processed internally by a event messaging system.
The main function is to provide a communication bus for all components of _OpenNMS_.

.Logging
Beside _OpenNMS_ self generated events or detected service outages it is possible to use _OpenNMS_ as a central logging application.
It supports supports external log messages like link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol#Trap[SNMP traps/informs] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog[Syslog].
By providing a extensible connector also 3rd party application can be used to generate monitoring events.

.Management Protocols
To provide access to management and monitoring information _OpenNMS_ natively implements the most common network management protocols like link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Management_Extensions[JMX], link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation[WMI] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol[SNMP].
Getting information from other application it is possible to gather information from 3rd party agents like link:http://www.nsclient.org/[NSClient++] or link:http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/nrpe/NRPE.pdf[NRPE].

.API and Scripts for Extensions
Sometimes there is no possibility to monitor a service by existing agents.
To give flexibility the service monitoring can be extended by scripts supported by the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_for_the_Java_Platform[JSR 223].
With an open Java API for service monitoring and performance data collection there are also possibilities to extend _OpenNMS_ in an efficient and scalable way.
